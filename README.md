# Simple Game (in progress)!

This project has been created using **webpack scaffold**, you can now run

```
npm run build
```

or

```
yarn build
```

to bundle your application<br>

To really run the thing just open the "index.html" on browser<br>
Oh yes, remember to run 'npm install', to get all dependences<br>
I made this following a book named "Desenvolva jogos com HTML5 Canvas e JavaScript Casa do Codigo"<br/>
The book write the code in JavaScript, but i made it in TypeScript<br/>
Feel free to clone this and modify anything you want<br>
PS: The sonic sprite is used by the book, and dont't have any participation on that decision<br>
PS 2: Ignore he error on the "tsconfig" file
